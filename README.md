### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alessandro Baldassarre and I am a third-year software engineering student at the Univeristy of Calgary. Throughout my years in software engineering, I have touched on quite a few topics regarding tech and my favourite is definitely web development. I love being able to apply changes to my code and see them come to life on my browser right away. I enjoy learning about any new technologies that will help me become the full-stack developer I aspire to be. I am currently learning node.js and express.js to then apply to a current project I am working on, a simple expenses and income tracker.
